        <h2>Hello User</h2>
        <p>You have been hacked and won't recive any ads or notifications.</p>
        <p>At least not from me.</p>
        <p>I will just monitor you bandwith usage for my own personal gain.</p>
        <p>The information I collect won't be published anywhere and will be used for</p>
        <p>my personal gain only. If you are still reading and want to know why I hacked</p>
        <p>you, It's because of my lust for knowledge. I want to know what are the most</p>
        <p>used passwords and how to implement that into my password cracking software. I will</p>
        <p>monitor your password entries and won't know from whom It came from. At least</p>
        <p>until I try to find you but that is unlikely because this e-mail has been sent</p>
        <p>to a lot of people and why would I try to find YOU. I hope that you will keep</p>
        <p>the secret and countinue to share your private information with me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If, for some reason, you don't want to be hacked you can contact me trough my e-mail:</p>
        <p>jan.lanit@gmail.com</p>
        <p>and the software will erase itself. Just in the subject part type: aabbaabbaabb</p>
